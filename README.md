# About myself

Growing up in a small town, the world often felt vast and intimidating, but an unlikely source sparked my curiosity towards science and technology the Bollywood film "Koi Mil Gaya." While some may find irony in a fictional movie igniting a passion for the intricacies of coding and AI, for me, it was the first step towards embracing the wonders of the digital realm.

With each line of code I wrote, I could create, innovate, and shape this realm. Coding became my canvas, my means of expression, and a constant reminder that barriers could be broken if approached with curiosity and determination.

Now, as I pursue my Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at VIT, I find myself at the forefront of a technological revolution. AI, once a mere concept, is rapidly becoming a reality, and I'm fortunate enough to be part of this transformative journey.
